description: I examine the calculations of ball park adjustments from the major stats websites. I believe ball park adjustments are often under-examined and methodologies need to be challeneged further.

It’s been almost two years since I decided to start writing a book about remote work for women.

I was visiting my family in Florida when I got a call from the [European Women in Technology](https://www.europeanwomenintech.com/){:target="_blank"} conference. They were following up with me to ask what I’d be interested in speaking about at their upcoming event. Almost as soon I started telling the organizers the story of how I built my [business](https://seafoam.media){:target="_blank"}, I was interrupted — *“Wait, you lead a team of people around the world?”*

That’s when I realized that things that felt so normal to me, like working remotely with globally distributed teams, were of huge interest to lots of other people. My conference talk at EWT 2018, titled [“The New Distributed Workforce,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgS3DZ0yjno){:target="_blank"} became the basis of my upcoming book, [*The Remote Work Era.*](https://remoteworkera.com){:target="_blank"}

In *The Remote Work Era* book, I have created exclusive step-by-step frameworks for women who want to find a remote job, build a freelancing career, or start a digital business. Packed with 50+ interviews from women around the world, if you want to go remote or grow in your remote career, I am confident that my book can put you on the right track!

*The Remote Work Era* book is set to be published this fall. In the meantime, while I’ve been putting finishing touches on the manuscript, I decided that it only made sense to create an actual community where readers, the women I interviewed for the book, and anyone else can join to ask questions and receive support. I am passionate about helping others and connecting people with new opportunities, and I’ve realized that the best way to do that is through a community.

**So, I would like to invite you to [The Remote Work Era: Women Going Remote](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2004084546399988/){:target="_blank"} community on Facebook!** Here, you can ask specific questions and I will do my best to respond personally. While the community is still small, I see this as an opportunity for me to offer micro-mentorship to anyone who asks for it. As we grow, I see it as an opportunity for us to all help and learn from each other.

**What you can gain from the Women Going Remote community:**

* Remote job & gig opportunities

* Feedback on websites, portfolios, resumes, cover letters & more

* Space to share where you’re stuck

* Expert guidance

* Space to share your accomplishments

* A network of global remote women to learn from & collaborate with

Once *[The Remote Work Era](https://remoteworkera.com){:target="_blank"}* book has been published, the [Women Going Remote community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2004084546399988){:target="_blank"} will also be a place where readers can ask specific questions about the content.

I look forward to seeing you there!
